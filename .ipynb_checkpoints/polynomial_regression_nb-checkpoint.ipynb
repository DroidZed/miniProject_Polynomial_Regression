        "In mathematics, a polynomial is a mathematical expression consisting of indeterminates (also called variables) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and exponentiation to nonnegative integer powers, and has a finite number of terms. An example of a polynomial of a single indeterminate x {\\displaystyle x} is x 2 - 4 x + 7 {\\displaystyle x^{2}-4x+7. An example with three indeterminates is x 3 + 2 x y z 2 - y z + 1 {\\displaystyle x^{3}+2xyz^{2}-yz+1}.\n",
